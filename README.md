# Project Name
This project is a Sentimental Analysis of the Social Media data of the user,Using Classification algorithm and Preprocessing using NLP.

### Description of the Project
• Conducted a comprehensive sentiment analysis of 10,000+ social media posts using NLP techniques, identified and analyzed public opinion and attitudes towards a specific brand, informing strategic decision-making
• Implemented advanced NLP techniques, including text preprocessing,tokenization, stemming, and lemmatization, resulting in a 40 Percent increase in sentiment analysis accuracy and a 25 Percent reduction in false 
  positives.
• Achieved an accuracy of 92 percent and an F1-score of 0.89 on the test set, using a Recurrent Neural Network model with Long Short-Term Memory.
